idg_domain_copy:
backup: Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
checksum: SHA1 checksum of the file being transferred. Used to validate that the copy of the file was successful. If this is not provided, ansible will use the local calculated checksum of the src file.
dest: Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If src is a directory, this must be a directory too. If dest is a nonexistent path and if either dest ends with "/" or src is a directory, dest is created. If src and dest are files, the parent directory of dest isn't created: the task fails if it doesn't already exist.
src: Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative. If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination. Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
